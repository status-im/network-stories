## Overview

#### Operating Definition:
[The widely accepted definition of the phrase.]<sup>1</sup>

#### Current "Standard" Implementation:
[Systems that are very similar to us or are the current "best-in-class" that we are trying to improve upon for a given factor (define context-relevant network assumptions per phrase, ideally we'll come up with visual sliding bars to show complex relationships between increasing/decreasing factors and how we go from "research" assumptions to "production" engineering) and why?]  

#### The Idea(l):
[The solution that is aligned with the original Ethereum ethos to which Status is preserving ideological alignment with.]

#### Logos Implementation:
[The research target/goal/Proof of Concept implementation currently under testing/experimentation.]
  
#### Live Feedback:
[Add a LIVE location where the research and/or development teams can be pinged in a specific text-channel dedicated to this that is within their specific Discord server so that conversation can be bridged between projects and on a program level in order to best plug into resolving better than current understanding on this specific topic. I.e., Vac/Waku/Codex/Logos Discord server and a specific text-channel for this concept like #(insert one of six layers under research).]

#### IMPORTANT Differentiators:
[Easy low-hanging fruit for marketing or communication that makes our implementation clearly different/better.]
 
#### Knowledge Share:
[Quickly share unread but potentially valuable resources and comments here to be re-read by someone else who can integrate them.]
