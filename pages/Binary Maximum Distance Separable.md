## Overview

#### Operating Definition:
Binary maximum distance separable<sup>1</sup> array codes are a special class of erasure codes for distributed storage that not only provide fault tolerance with minimum storage redundancy but also achieve low computational complexity. They are constructed by encoding k information columns with r parity columns, in which each element in a column is a bit, such that any k out of the k + r columns suffice to recover all information bits. 

#### Principles
[What principle(s) are we trying to protect by innovating on this front? The solution that is aligned with the original Ethereum ethos to which Status is preserving ideological alignment with.] see [[Principles]]

#### Implementation
- Description and Explanation
	[Technical Why goes here. Systems that are very similar to us or are the current "best-in-class" that we are trying to improve upon for a given factor (define context-relevant network assumptions per phrase, ideally we'll come up with visual sliding bars to show complex relationships between increasing/decreasing factors and how we go from "research" assumptions to "production" engineering) and why?]  
- Key Differences:
	[Easy low-hanging fruit for marketing or communication that makes our implementation clearly different/better.]
- Additional Information:
	[Quickly share unread but potentially valuable resources and comments here to be re-read by someone else who can integrate them.]
