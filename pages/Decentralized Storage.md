Large scale peer-to-peer systems are foreseen as a way to provide highly reliable at low cost. To achieve high durability, such P2P systems encode the user data in a set of redundant fragments and distribute them among the peers. In this paper we study the impact of different data placement strategies on the system performance when using erasure codes redundancy schemes. We compare three policies: two of them local, in which the data are stored in logical neighbors, and the other one global, in which the
