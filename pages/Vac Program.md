## **How-To (Get Cookin')**
*Instructions: There are some descriptions below which detail the usage of visual guidance metrics available in the form of "cookbook-like" instructions for how to consume this document:*

|  Gauges  |     Description    | Visualization |
| -------- | :-----------: |  :----------:  |
|Difficulty| 1-10 (Ticks/Pips) |  [&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;]  | 
|Time      | In Minutes | X Minutes |
|Resources | Article/Video Links w/ Visual Content | Conceptual & Pictoral "Ingredients List" of Links|

### **Operating Definitions:**

Prep (*Difficulty*) is defined as the ease of which the concepts can be generally understood. (Future: Make into more fun visual or something more enjoyable than a difficulty bar.)

Cook Time (*Scope*) is in reference to the size of information necessary to learn to gain a decent level of comprehension.

Ingredients (*Resources*) is for links relevant to helping people understand the concepts. Number references and use superscript notation to reference mentions in terminology Recipes descriptions.

	Future Work: Adjust difficulty/time ratings, cook time respec. based on feedback from everyone at DXB.

See Sample below:
