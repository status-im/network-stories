- Jane wakes up
- After reading a proposal in her XXX [[Community]] about implementing a new zero-knowledge solution for votes, she is bewildered by the technical jargon but fascinated by its implications. She navigates to the voting dashboard to see more information, and notices the vote to pass the proposal only has 2 weeks left. She decides this isn't enough time to get the level of understanding she would like to have for voting, so she decides to delegate her voting power to her more technical friend, Mark. 
  
  Jane holds a significant amount of voting power within this community as she's been contributing to it for years while Mark is relatively new.
