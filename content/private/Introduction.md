## Thoughts
- Imagine if the focus of your digital assets was around _what_ they did for you instead how much they were worth.
	- The value of such a viewpoint puts the utility of a given asset as a priority, and then allows you to reason about that utility's value (or perceived value).
	- A portfolio turns into an access panel to different functions within different communities.
	- Price becomes a measurement of what someone is willing to pay for that access and functionality.
