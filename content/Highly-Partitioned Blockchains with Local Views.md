`ELI5: Concept that you can have a network of nodes coming into agreement upon multiple different types of data at the same time (subnets in Avalanche). Then, with any given piece of information, we look at how much you can partition that information within that group (parallelization of information) to try to minimize the amount of work any given node needs to do. Parallelization of work between heavier nodes and lighter nodes can allow both to be relevant within the group.`
