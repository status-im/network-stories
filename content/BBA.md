ELI5: Process of a distributed network coming to an agreement between two options OR the proposal, decision-making process, and eventual conclusion/convergence of a two-option Byzantine-contexted scenario.

## Overview

#### Operating Definition:
Binary byzantine consensus concerns the problem of getting a set of distinct processes distributed across a network to agree on a single binary value 0 or 1 where processes can fail in arbitrary ways.<sup>1</sup>

#### Principles
[What principle(s) are we trying to protect by innovating on this front? The solution that is aligned with the original Ethereum ethos to which Status is preserving ideological alignment with.]

#### Implementation
- Description and Explanation
	[Technical Why goes here. Systems that are very similar to us or are the current "best-in-class" that we are trying to improve upon for a given factor (define context-relevant network assumptions per phrase, ideally we'll come up with visual sliding bars to show complex relationships between increasing/decreasing factors and how we go from "research" assumptions to "production" engineering) and why?]  
- Key Differences:
	[Easy low-hanging fruit for marketing or communication that makes our implementation clearly different/better.]
- Additional Information:
	[Quickly share unread but potentially valuable resources and comments here to be re-read by someone else who can integrate them.]
