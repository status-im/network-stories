# Understanding Project Waku
---

## **Purpose**
```
The first protocol in Logos’ stack is Waku, which has its origins in Ethereum’s Whisper protocol, but is optimized for scalability and better usability.

Waku removes centralized third parties from messaging - enabling private, secure, censorship-free communication.  Waku is designed for generalized messaging, enabling both human-to-human or machine-to-machine communication.
