## Overview

#### Operating Definition:
A group of nodes that share key characteristics<sup>1</sup> of:
	1. Scale of ~10 nodes, while others could (potentially) scale up to current blockchain limits
	2. Varying degrees of inter-communication and interdependence
	3. "CICs... could exist completely independently as a separate infrastructure."

#### Current "Standard" Implementation:
On Ethereum, the process of agreement is done by everyone in the entire network. If someone has a decision that needs to come to agreement on, the entire network has to process that data.

#### The Idea(l):
The ability for groups with various use-cases to be able to find where they can situate themselves either within the main network or as branches in smaller networks.

#### Logos Implementation:
We are trying to separate the ability for individual groups to come to agreement on their own data together and not be affected by groups outside of themselves unless they've explicitly attached themselves to them. 
We will give the ability for a smaller subset of a large number of nodes to come together and specify on validating a smaller group of data they want to come together on and most consensus mechanisms do not allow for that.

#### Live Feedback:


#### IMPORTANT Differentiators:
Validators on Avalanche must validate default (primary) subnet in order to participate on validation of other subnets (public or private). We (as Status Network/Logos) want to be able to allow for the disintermediation of overlap that exists between validator nodes so they have the option to operate by overlap or be **completely independent** of Status's (primary) subnet if they so choose to. 
Currently, there is NO network that allows for this type of behavior.
