## **Purpose**
```
This document reflects an approach of whitepaper review that combines a rough-draft whitepaper review containing comments/reflections/concerns with a further simplification of concepts to make everything more digestible to more people outside of the internal Status infra team for communication purposes. In addition, this review will provide a gauge of difficulty of understanding involved with various different terms/concepts.
