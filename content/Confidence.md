`ELI5: How confident am I with each round or iteration of questioning that I am getting or have gotten to the right answer (convergence of iterative process)? Interpretation (economic, reputation (see Ikingut Reputation Algorithm, et al) of accumulated data in order to reach a certain probabalistic threshold of agreement. Poll network based on your local view of "weight" instead of Avalanche's "staked weight". The amount of staked weight, or weight a given node has, dictates the probability of when it is polled in the network. When you increase stake in the network, you get polled more often for your decisions in the network. In PBFT you need to have complete knowledge of who is participating in each round of consensus.`
